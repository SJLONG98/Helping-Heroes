TODO:
- Inspect on webpage currently shows anyone the scripts used for the website - this is something we need to disallow
- Sort out uploading Date format fields to the database
- Add image uploads for accounts (and maybe jobs)
- Match Postcodes for users based on job distance data
  - MVP will be scaled on area, district and subdistrict
- Postcode needs to be verified as real
  - MVP will use a table sourced from free database from online (Joe has this stored locally)
- Address:Postcode matchup (could be added to MVP)
- Apply timescale rules to jobs
- Basic design for the website
  - Colour scheme, fonts and accessibility
  - Bootstrap or similar for responsive webpages
- User being notified on account/ job updates
  - MVP will have an indication on the User.php page
  - MVP could have email notifications
- Ensure high security standards
  - Prevent all SQL Injections
  - Hide variable access from users
- Password reset capabilities

DONE:
- Uploading a file seems to not forward the user back to a webpage and stays on uploadFile.php; this occurs even with a successful upload
  - This was fixed by removing all outputs in the file outside of headers (removal of `echo` commands)
